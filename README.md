Module 10 Challenge

This challenge is a climate analysis about Honolulu, Hawaii.  I have been provided csv files with data to analyse

Using sqlalchemy, created a relational map across the 2 csv files provided.

We only wanted to look at the last 12 months precitpitation data so calculated the 12 month window using the measurement date and copied this into a new datafram called precipitaiton_df.

I was then able to create a bar graph.
Along with the bar graph, there are summary statistics proivded for revision.


Some analysis of weather stations was also done.  
A count of how many times a weather station has provided measurement data, and then for the station with highest number of active uses, a lower level investgaion of the lowest, highest and average temperature was calculated. 

Another bar graph was done to display the temperature range and the frequency of each.
